# VIRTUAL-KEYBOARD

This project is a virtual keyboard that allows users to input text and control their computer without a physical keyboard. It is designed to be a flexible and user-friendly solution for individuals who may have limited access to traditional keyboards, such as those with physical disabilities or using touch-based devices.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** The virtual keyboard provides a familiar layout, resembling a standard physical keyboard, making it easy for users to adapt.
- **Multiple Input Options:** Users can interact with the virtual keyboard using various input methods, including mouse clicks, touch gestures, or even through head tracking devices.
- **Customizable Layouts:** The keyboard layout can be easily customized to suit individual preferences or specific requirements. Users can add or remove keys, change key sizes, and rearrange them as needed.
- **Multilingual Support:** The virtual keyboard supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between different keyboard layouts seamlessly.
- **Accessibility Features:** It includes accessibility features like key repeat rate adjustment, dwell-clicking, and sticky keys, making it more accessible to individuals with motor impairments.
- **Auto-correct and Word Prediction:** The keyboard can be enhanced with auto-correct and word prediction functionalities, improving typing speed and accuracy.
- **Clipboard Support:** Users can easily copy and paste text using the virtual keyboard, enabling efficient text manipulation.
